# Project_1

This project will give insights from data about movie revenue trends from 2010 to 2018. The goal is to make business stakeholders make clear and smart decisions on what kind of movies to produce that would increase their chances of success considering the high competition in the film industru. This knowledge can help stakeholders minimize financial risk and earn their profit returns by focusing on films that have the highest ratings over the years. By looking at this, we were able to breakdown the movies based on the genre and movie studio that produced it to help determine the factors that led to it's success
## PROJECT OVERVIEW

After analyzing the movie data available from IMDb and Box Office Mojo, we found out:

- Which ratings (like PG-13 or R) make the most money
- What movie genres make the most money
- Whether longer or shorter movies do better
- Whether big studios make more successful movie
- If certain age ratings bring in more money

The insights in this report can help Microsoft make data-informed decisions about what kinds of films to produce.

##  Key Insights

1.  Big studios often have better marketing and reach.
2.  Dramas and documentaries tend to earn less, possibly due to niche audiences.
3.  Movies between 100â€“130 minutes tend to perform best.
4.  Some genres consistently perform better (e.g., superhero/action).
5.   Movies that are part of a known series or based on popular books/comics (e.g., Marvel, Star Wars) tend to outperform originals.
6.  Action, Adventure, Fantasy, and Superhero genres often earn the most.
