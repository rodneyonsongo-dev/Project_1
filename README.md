This succulent knowledge can help stakeholders minimize financial risk and earn their profit returns by focusing on films that have the highest ratings over the years. Here we used data between years of  2010 to 2018 which include international and domestic gross for the many number of movies produced.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

After analyzing the most public available movie data from IMDb and Box Office Mojo, we found out:

- Which ratings (like PG-13 or R) make the most money?
- What movie genres make the most money?
- Whether longer or shorter movies do better?
- Whether big studios make more successful movie?
- Which company made or released the movie?
- If certain age ratings bring in more money?

The insights in this report can help Microsoft make data-informed decisions about what kinds of films to produce.
